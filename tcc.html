            <h3>CHALLENGE</h3>
            <p>Even though The Clothing Club has been active for the past 5 years, they never fully establish their digital presence. As for now, their only means of communication with the target audience were Instagram and Facebook posts. Only in recent times, they’ve felt the need to fully rebrand, expand their target audience and introduce a new communication channel. And thus, they saw the necessity of having a website. </p>
            <p>The biggest challenge we might encounter during this project is adjusting the solution to the specific needs of the diverse target audience and TCC’s requirements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="item">
            <h3>SOLUTION</h3>
            <p>We want to increase the awareness of The Clothing Club among their potential customers and develop their digital presence.  To achieve that we created a website promoting our client as well as a guide for their potential content.</p>

              where we organize all accumulated data so far. </p>
        <p>We used this marketing strategy to divide TCC’s total
             addressable market share into smaller groups - 
             segments. Each segment shares common characteristics
              that enabled us to create targeted products, which would later
               be developed as different sections in our solution.</p>

        <h4>The Result</h4>

        <p>• Want to save money</p>
